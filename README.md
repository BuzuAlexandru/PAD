# Simulating a live-service game with a randomized reward system and microtransactions
A gacha system where you can obtain heroes or items by spending currency on a "banner" that represents an item pool. Complete with an account system where you can spend to buy said currency.

## Application Suitability

Microservices are ideal for complex applications with diverse features that benefit from independent development and scaling. A video game with microtransactions and randomized loot systems is a strong candidate for microservices due to the following reasons:

1. **Complexity**: The game has multiple components (gameplay, microtransactions, inventory) that can be developed and maintained separately.
2. **Scalability**: Microservices allow for independent scaling, ensuring services like microtransactions or game sessions can handle traffic surges without affecting other systems.
3. **Fault Isolation**: If one service fails (e.g., transactions), others (e.g., gameplay) remain functional.
4. **Independent Deployment**: Teams can update services (like loot mechanics) independently, reducing system-wide downtime.
5. **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use different technologies suited to their needs, enhancing performance.

### Real-World Example

**Genshin Impact** (miHoYo) as a gacha game,  it uses microservices to handle randomized loot mechanics, player progression, and in-game purchases, scaling these systems separately for millions of users. Example Services: randomized loot/gacha pull service, player progress and inventory service, payment and transaction service.

## Service Boundaries

- Account service - responsible for authentication and procuring currency.
- Gacha service - responsible for randomized reward system.

## Technology Stack and Communication Patterns
- API Gateway: ExpressJS, NodeJS
- Service Discovery: Javascript
- Services: Python, Flask
- Cache: Redis
- Databases: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT

The Gateway and Service discovery will communicate via gRPC, the rest will use REST APIs for information exchange.

**Task timeouts** can be implemented by setting a maximum execution time for each request using `asyncio` in Python , and enforce **concurrent task limits** by using worker queues to control the number of tasks running simultaneously.

Load Balancing can be implemented using a simple counter to cycle through a list of server addresses. Each incoming request is directed to the next server in the list

## Data Management
Each service will have its own database and use REST APIs for data access.

## Lab 2
1. **Circuit Breaker with Failover Mechanism**:
   - Retry a request up to 3 times before switching to another service instance.
   - Show error only when all services are unavailable.
2. **Service High Availability**:
   + Elimination of single points of failure. This means adding or building redundancy into the system so that failure of a component does not mean failure of the entire system.
   * Reliable crossover. In redundant systems, the crossover point itself tends to become a single point of failure. Reliable systems must provide for reliable crossover.
   + Detection of failures as they occur. If the two principles above are observed, then a user may never see a failure â€“ but the maintenance activity must.
3. **ELK Stack or Prometheus + Grafana for Logging** (whichever is easier to set-up):
   - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Prometheus + Grafana for aggregating logs and metrics from all services.
   - Provides centralized logging, real-time metrics, and alerting.

4. **Microservice-based 2-Phase Commit**:
   - 2-Phase Commit: Ensures atomicity across multiple microservices (databases) by committing changes in two phases.
   - Long-running saga transactions: As an alternative to 2PC, using a saga pattern with a coordinator to manage long transactions across services.

5. **Consistent Hashing for Cache**:
   - Distribute cache data across multiple nodes using consistent hashing to reduce cache reorganization.
   - Done using Redis Clusters.

6. **Database Redundancy/Replication with Failover**:
   - Using database replication techniques (PostgreSQL master-slave replication) to create multiple replicas.
   - Automatic failover to secondary database instances in case of primary database failure.
   - Minimum 3 replicas for redundancy.

7. **Data Warehouse and ETL**:
   - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Implement periodic ETL processes to aggregate data from various services' databases into a Data Warehouse for analytics and reporting.

These technologies and techniques ensure the system is fault-tolerant, scalable, and efficient, with improved monitoring, high availability, and data integrity across microservices.
